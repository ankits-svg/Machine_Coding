## Introduction

Throttling and debouncing are techniques used to control how often a function is called, particularly in response to events such as user input or scroll events. These techniques help optimize performance and reduce the frequency of resource-intensive operations.

## Throttling

Throttling ensures that a function is executed at a maximum rate, allowing it to run at regular intervals. It limits the number of times a function can be called within a specified time frame.

### Throttling Process

1. When an event occurs, the throttling mechanism starts a timer.
2. If the timer is not active, the function is executed immediately.
3. If the timer is already active (from a previous execution), subsequent calls to the function are ignored until the timer expires.
4. After the timer expires, the function can be called again.


## Debouncing

Debouncing ensures that a function is executed only after a certain period of inactivity following the triggering event. It prevents the function from running too frequently, especially during rapid user input.

### Debouncing Process

1. When an event occurs, the debouncing mechanism starts a timer.
2. If the timer is already active (from a previous event), it is reset.
3. The function is executed only after the timer expires and there is no further event activity.

**Throttling and debouncing are valuable techniques for improving the performance and responsiveness of JavaScript and React applications. They help manage the rate at which functions are executed, reducing unnecessary computations and preventing excessive API requests or event handling. By incorporating these techniques, you can enhance the user experience and optimize your application's performance.**
